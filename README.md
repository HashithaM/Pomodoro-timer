# Pomodoro-timer
This is a simple pomodoro timer application for work time scheduling
This Python code creates a simple Pomodoro timer application using the Tkinter library, which is a standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit for Python. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

Importing Libraries: The code starts by importing the necessary modules, Tkinter for GUI and math for mathematical operations.

Constants: Several constants are defined, including colors (PINK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW), font name, and durations for work, short break, and long break periods.

Timer Reset Function: reset_timer() function resets the timer by canceling any ongoing timer (after_cancel() method), resetting the timer display to "00:00", resetting the title label, and clearing the checkmarks.

Timer Mechanism Function: start_timer() function initiates the timer. It increments the reps counter and based on the current repetition count, it sets the appropriate label text (WORK, SHORT BREAK, LONG BREAK) and initiates the countdown using the count_down() function.

Countdown Mechanism Function: count_down() function handles the countdown logic. It takes a parameter count representing the number of seconds to count down. It calculates minutes and seconds, updates the timer display on the canvas, and schedules itself to be called again after 1 second (after() method). When the countdown reaches 0, it either starts the next session or break based on the current count of repetitions (reps) and updates the checkmarks accordingly.

UI Setup: The code sets up the user interface using Tkinter. It creates the main window (Tk()), sets its title, padding, and background color. It creates a Canvas widget to display the tomato image and timer text. Labels are created for displaying the timer title and checkmarks. Buttons for starting and resetting the timer are also added.

Main Loop: Finally, the main event loop (mainloop()) is started, which listens for events and keeps the GUI application running.

Overall, this code creates a simple Pomodoro timer application with start, reset functionality, and visual indicators for work sessions and breaks.
